                (born October 2, 1869, Porbandar, India—died January 30, 1948, Delhi), Indian lawyer, politician, social activist, and writer who became the leader of the
                 nationalist movement against the British rule of India.
                 As such, he came to be considered the father of his country. Gandhi is internationally esteemed for his 
                 doctrine of nonviolent protest (satyagraha) to achieve political and 
                 social progress.In the eyes of millions of his fellow Indians, Gandhi was the Mahatma (“Great Soul”).
                 The unthinking adoration of the huge crowds that gathered to see him all along the route of
                  his tours made them a severe ordeal; he could hardly work during the day or rest at night.
                   “The woes of the Mahatmas,” he wrote, “are known only to the Mahatmas.” His fame spread worldwide during
                    his lifetime and only increased after his death. The name Mahatma Gandhi is now one of the most universally recognized on earth.</p>
