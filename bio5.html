                Born of a Dalit Mahar family of western India, he was as a boy humiliated by his high-caste schoolfellows. 
                His father was an officer in the Indian army. Awarded a scholarship by the Gaekwar (ruler) of Baroda (now Vadodara),
                 he studied at universities in the United States, Britain, and Germany. He entered the Baroda Public Service at the Gaekwar’s request,
                  but, again ill-treated by his high-caste colleagues, he turned to legal practice and to teaching. He soon established his leadership among Dalits,
                   founded several journals on their behalf, and succeeded in obtaining special representation for them in the legislative councils 
                   of the government. Contesting Mahatma Gandhi’s claim to speak for Dalits (or Harijans, as Gandhi called them), 
                he wrote What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables (1945).</p>
