                India [now in Pakistan]—died March 23, 1931, Lahore [now in Pakistan]), revolutionary hero of the Indian independence movement.Bhagat Singh attended Dayanand Anglo Vedic High School, which was operated by Arya Samaj (a reform sect of modern Hinduism), 
                and then National College, both located in Lahore. He began to protest British rule in India while still a youth and soon fought 
                for national independence. He also worked as a writer and editor in Amritsar for Punjabi- and Urdu-language newspapers espousing 
                Marxist theories. He is credited with popularizing the catchphrase “Inquilab zindabad” (“Long live the revolution”).
                In 1928 Bhagat Singh plotted with others to kill the police chief responsible for the death of Indian writer and politician 
                Lala Lajpat Rai, one of the founders of National College, during a silent march opposing the Simon Commission. Instead, in a 
                case of mistaken identity, junior officer J.P. Saunders was killed, and Bhagat Singh had to flee Lahore to escape the death penalty.
                 In 1929 he and an associate lobbed a bomb at the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi to protest the implementation of the Defence of
                  India Act and then surrendered. 
                He was hanged at the age of 23 for the murder of Saunders.</p>
